# Badi Coding Challenge Submission - Bassem Mawhoob
![Zombies at Badi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4199523/33260366-e54216aa-d35f-11e7-8442-8d9e1cd67d88.jpg)

## The context
My name Grizzly Bow and I am a humozombotic scientist specializing in micro-genetic transformation (atleast, that's what they told me in college). I was anonymously informed that the world need my expertise to defend or destroy it, no clue yet. That's why I decided to invade the world my latest creation, Zombie 1.0.1.1a. Below you'll find my secrets on how this marvelous creation took place. http://badi-bmaw.herokuapp.com/

## Documentation & Usage
* A full documentation of the API along with a complete set of example requests for this project are at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3752258/badi-backend-challenge/RVfyBpWs

## Technical Discussion
* Build a performant, clean and well structured solution;
* Commit **early and often**. We want to be able to check your progress;
* Feel free to address the problem creatively according to your programming tastes (there are always multiple ways to achieve the same goal) and try to use elegant solutions. 

## The Challenge

Create a fully-working API that allows to perform the following operations:

1. Create Zombies. Each zombie can have weapons and armors;
2. Update a Zombie's attributes, including (but not limited to) weapons and armors;
4. Search Zombies according to their attributes, weapons and armors;
3. Destroy a Zombie;
5. Make your API public. Deploy it using the service of your choice (e.g. AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean...);
6. Create a Readme file including a short explanation of your technical choices and (if you wish) ideas and suggestions.

Too easy? Great, we think so too!
That's why we encourage candidates to go the extra mile and impress us in any way they deem appropriate (as long as it is related to this challenge ;).
